Project TESTI: Sensors & Actuators with 0-10VDC Signals Mobile Tester

Description:
Project TESTI aims to create a mobile testing device capable of interfacing with various sensors and actuators utilizing signals within the 0-10VDC range.

Key Features:
Sensors & Actuators Interface:

ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) operating in DMA mode with a Median Filter for precise input signal readings.
DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) for generating output signals within the 0-10VDC range.
Connectivity:

SPI DMA for controlling the ILI9341 display.
I2C interface for power measurement using the INA219.
Control:

PWMs for managing brightness, motors, and buzzer functions.
Functional Highlights:
DMA Mode with Median Filter for ADC: Enables rapid and accurate acquisition of sensor signals through Direct Memory Access (DMA) mode combined with a Median Filter for enhanced data precision.
SPI DMA with ILI9341 Display: Provides a high-speed interface to drive the ILI9341 graphical display, allowing for visual representation of measurement data or system status.
I2C with INA219 for Power Measurement: Enables precise measurement of power and current consumption, beneficial for monitoring energy usage of devices.
PWM Control Implementation: Facilitates control over display brightness, motor speeds, and sound signaling.
Applications:
Project TESTI finds application across diverse fields, including measurements, automation, control systems, and more, owing to its flexibility and multifunctionality.
